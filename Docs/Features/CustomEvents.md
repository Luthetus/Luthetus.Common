## Intent
Similar to the `@onclick` Blazor event, one can define their own custom Blazor events.

In [luthetusCommon.js (src link)](../../Source/Lib/Luthetus.Common.RazorLib/wwwroot/luthetusCommon.js): `Blazor.registerCustomEventType('keydownwithpreventscroll', ...`

As well in [EventHandlers.cs (src link)](../../Source/Lib/Luthetus.Common.RazorLib/CustomEvents/EventHandlers.cs)
