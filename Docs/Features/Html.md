## Intent
This seems unnecesary. I think I wanted to reference a CSS variable from within C#.

Its quite useless to have this logic because I'm interpolating it into a string and then setting an HTML element's style string from what I can tell?

I imagine I could interpolate `var(--luth_button-padding)` to the HTML element's style string. It would then evaluate to '6px'.

TODO: What was I trying to accomplish here? Should this be changed?
