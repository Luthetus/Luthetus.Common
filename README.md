![Example GIF](/Media/Gifs/root-readme-gif.gif)

***BlazorCommon*** is a general case component library using
the [Blazor UI Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
for [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

## Introduction

I have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzhWhqYVP40as1MFUesQM9w) where I document the making this Nuget Package.

## Goal

The aim of BlazorCommon is to contain Blazor components that I frequently use across a variety of projects, yet are not overly cumbersome.

One can make use of this Text Editor by referencing the Nuget Package or cloning the source code and referencing it
directly.
